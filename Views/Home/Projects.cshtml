                <p>
                    BucStop is a website that provided ETSU students with classic arcade games to play while waiting
                    for class. My main role was a developer while also working on the CI/CD side of things
                    with the website. My contributions included making a fully automated CI/CD Pipeline where it would
                    test the devs code automatically then automatically build the website with Docker. Languages used:
                    HTML, C#, Python, bash.
