        I'm a software developer with a passion for building impactful, user-centered applications. 
        With a background in C#, .NET, and CI/CD practices, I thrive in creating efficient and reliable solutions. 
        My journey in tech started with a love for problem-solving, and it has evolved into a career where I can bring 
        ideas to life through code. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges.
